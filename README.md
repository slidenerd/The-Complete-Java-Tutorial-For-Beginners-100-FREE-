This video shows you how to install Java JDK on Mac OSX. In the first step, go to Google and search for 'Download Java JDK'. Java JDK stands for Java Development Kit which is a software comprised a Java Virtual Machine or JVM along with a bunch of other tools needed to run our Java applications. The applications can either be a part of of the Java Enterprise Edition or Java Standard Edition or Java Mobile Edition. In our case, we are trying to develop applications for the Java Standard Edition or desktop applications. Accept the terms and conditions on Oracle's website and click the download button after selecting your platform. In our case, we will download Java 64 bit. Install Java with default settings on Mac OSX. The root Java folder has a jdk_xxx folder which represents the root jdk folder. Inside this folder, we have another folder called bin that stands for binaries. There are two binaries located here namely 'java' and 'javac'. Launch the terminal and navigate to the 'bin' folder. Try running the 'java' or 'javac' command. If you get an error that says 'java is not recognized as an internal or external command', it would mean that there were some problems while installing Java. Check the end of this video that shows how to deal with such problems. If there are no errors. go ahead and type 'java -version' in the command prompt and it should show you the version of Java that you downloaded and installed. If that is the case, we are all set to code our Java applications.
